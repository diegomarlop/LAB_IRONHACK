# In this activity we are going to do some database maintenance 
# In the current database we only have information on movies for the year 2006. 
# Now we have received the film catalog for 2020 as well. For this new data we will create another table and bulk insert all the data there. 
# Code to create a new table has been provided below.

### Instructions
#1. In the table actor, what last names are not repeated? For example if you would sort the data in the table actor by last_name, 
#you would see that there is Christian Arkoyd, Kirsten Arkoyd, and Debbie Arkoyd. 
#These three actors have the same last name. So we do not want to include this last name in our output. 
#Last name "Astaire" is present only one time with actor "Angelina Astaire", hence we would want this in our output list. 

select last_name from sakila.actor
group by last_name
having count(*) = 1;

#2.Which last names appear more than once? 
#We would use the same logic as in the previous question but this time we want to include the last names of the actors 
#where the last name was present more than once
select last_name from sakila.actor
group by last_name
having count(*) > 1;

#3. Using the rental table, find out how many rentals were processed by each employee.
select staff_id,count(*) from sakila.rental
group by staff_id;

#4. Using the film table, find out how many films were released.
select count(*) from sakila.film
group by release_year;

#5. Using the film table, find out how many films there are of each rating.
select count(*),rating from sakila.film
group by rating;

#6. What is the mean length of the film for each rating type. Round off the average lengths to two decimal places
select avg(length) as 'mean length' ,rating from sakila.film
group by rating;

#7. Which kind of movies (rating) have a mean duration of more than two hours?
select avg(length) as mean_length, rating from sakila.film
group by rating
having mean_length > 120;
